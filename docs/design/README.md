## Design Process

For any non-trivial feature or user interface change, a design document is
encouraged. This helps maintainers understand the motivation behind requests and
allows them to give feedback early. This should help ensure contributor's time
is used most effectively.

To create a design proposal, create a PR with the proposal. Be sure to describe
the problem you're trying to solve and any use cases. The PR review will be used
to iterate over the design.
