# Contributing to the Project

<!-- Microsoft contribution minimal template -->
This project welcomes contributions and suggestions. Most contributions require
you to agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have
the right to, and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution.
For details, visit <https://cla.microsoft.com>.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether
you need to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately
(e.g., label, comment). Simply follow the instructions provided by the bot. You
will only need to do this once across all repositories using our CLA.
